Our aim through our Art & Events fundraisers has been to give back to our patrons and supporters, by not only having the satisfaction and goodwill associated with helping someone less privileged through their generosity, but also to take home a tangible memory with them - to remind them of the smiles they have painted on the faces of KHUSHII beneficiaries, and the brighter futures they have helped build.</b></p>

This project seeks to address the issue of insufficient school preparedness in children by developing the existing preschool support mechanism to strengthen capacity building and resource support to workers. In line with the specific objectives of the project- strengthening pre-school education and health status of children in age group 0 to 6 years, it focuses on enhancing the capacity of supervisors, improvement in infrastructure and monitoring attendance, retention and development of children.
